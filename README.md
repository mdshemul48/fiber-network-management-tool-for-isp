# Optic Fiber Network Visualization

## Introduction

This project displays an ISP's fiber network on Google Maps. The software allows the ISP to view and manage their cable network, including information on the location of optical fiber cables and the availability of cores. The ISP can also manage devices such as ONUs, splitters, OLTs, and switches. The integration of Google Maps provides a visual representation of the network, making it easy for the ISP to understand and manage their fiber network.

## Features

- Visual representation of the fiber network on Google Maps
- Management of the location of optic fiber cables and core availability
- Management of network devices such as ONU, splitter, OLT, and switch
- Intuitive interface with all necessary information for effective network management
- User-friendly and flexible solution

## Technologies Used

- React Js
- Node Js
- MongoDB
- Express Js
- Google Map API
